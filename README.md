# thisisnourel — Nourelhouda's Portfolio ✨

Welcome to the source code of [thisisnourel.com](https://thisisnourel.com) — a minimalist, responsive, and intentional personal portfolio built using **Next.js 15**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**.  
It showcases my journey as a **UI/UX Designer** and **Frontend Developer**, with a focus on clean visuals, thoughtful storytelling, and performance.
